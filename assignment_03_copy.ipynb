        "    - Coding Standards (5 Points): Code should be readable and maintainable. Ensure appropriate variable naming and code commenting.\n",
        "    - Documentation (6 Points): Provide explanations or reasoning for using a particular command and describe the outputs. Avoid vague descriptions; aim for clarity and depth.\n",
        "    - Runtime (3 Points): The code should execute without errors and handle possible exceptions.\n",
        "    - Efficiency (3 Points): Implement efficient coding practices, avoid redundancy, and optimize for performance where applicable.\n",
