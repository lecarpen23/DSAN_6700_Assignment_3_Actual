        "    - Coding Standards (5 Points): Code should be readable and maintainable. Ensure appropriate variable naming and code commenting.\n",
        "    - Documentation (6 Points): Provide explanations or reasoning for using a particular command and describe the outputs. Avoid vague descriptions; aim for clarity and depth.\n",
        "    - Runtime (3 Points): The code should execute without errors and handle possible exceptions.\n",
        "    - Efficiency (3 Points): Implement efficient coding practices, avoid redundancy, and optimize for performance where applicable.\n",
        "  - Collaborative Programming (13 Points)\n",
        "    - GitHub Repository Structure (3 Points): A well-organized repository with clear directory structures and meaningful file names.\n",
        "    - Number of Commits (3 Points): Reflects steady progress and contributions from all group members.\n",
        "    - Commit Quality (3 Points): Clear, descriptive commit messages representing logical chunks of work. Avoid trivial commits like \"typo fix.\"\n",
        "    - Collaboration & Contribution (4 Points): Demonstrated teamwork where each member contributes significantly. This can be seen through pull requests, code reviews, and merge activities.\n",
